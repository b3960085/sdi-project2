<article>
<p>This week I continued with my mobile application theme. I continue to believe this theme should be readily adaptable to almost any example scenario. By leveraging areas such as song durations, remote server availability, and parsing selected track details into presentable information, I was able to create a program that follows the designated project flowchart.</p>
<p>That being said, I feel it necessary to draw attention to the additional complication in my submission. Starting out, I did not intend to add so many derivations to my project, but I felt that overall they helped to enhance the quality of my work. Implementing checks for "edge case" scenarios and my desire to present human-readable (That is, not include words "true or false" in a context that doesn't feel natural.) lead to additional complexity. For example, my desire to handle a situation wherein there are no artists to sync (Meaning that my number function was supplied with arguments that would result in output such as "0 artists have been synced", etc.) lead me to complicate my while loop with negative numbers to denote a "zero-sync" (the aforementioned results) state so I could output different text and break the loop. Because of this, I had to implement a similar break in the main area of the loop to prevent contradictory and repetitive output ("Finished syncing", then "No artists to sync"). Similar edge-case handling can be found in the selectedSongDurations() function wherein I check to ensure that the number of selected songs will not query for more items than my sample array contains. This introduced addition complexity into my for statement as well. I also added in commentable lines that changed the output and flow of the program for ease of use. The best example would be the commented if statement when "syncing" artists that will change the output from 1-by-1 to every 10th. I wanted the option to ensure iteration was taking place while also having the ability to shorten the output.</p>
<p>Finally, when it came to the matter of output, I wanted to render text that felt natural and made sense. This results in two possible statements that are determined by the returned boolean from earlier in the program but I didn't actually output the variable into the string. I wanted the program output to appear natural rather than programmatic. To ensure that I met the requirements of the assignment by actually outputting all of my returned variables, I created a "Debug output" area that I felt followed the theme of a mobile application. This outputs variables returned from the previous functions as well as important input variables that affect the flow and output of the program.</p>
